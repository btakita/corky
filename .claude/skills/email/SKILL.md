# email

Draft, format, and send emails from agent-doc sessions. Handles HTML formatting, Gmail threading, and multiple delivery paths.

## Invocation

```
/email draft <recipient> <subject>   — draft a new email or reply
/email send <draft-file>             — send a draft via corky or browser
/email html <draft-file>             — save HTML version for browser paste
```

## Commands

### `draft` — Create or Reply to Email

Draft a new email or reply to an existing thread.

**Steps:**
1. If replying, search `mail/conversations/` for the thread
2. Extract both the RFC 2822 `Message-ID` and the Gmail `Thread ID`, plus the original subject
3. Create draft via `corky draft new --to <recipient> --in-reply-to <message-id> --thread-id <thread-id> "<subject>"`
4. Write email content to the draft file
5. Set status to `approved`

**Reply threading:**
- Always search `mail/conversations/` for existing threads with the recipient
- Extract Thread ID from the conversation file
- Use `--in-reply-to` with the thread ID
- Preserve the original subject with `Re:` prefix (Gmail threading requires matching subjects)

### `send` — Send a Draft

**IMPORTANT: Never send automatically.** See `runbooks/email-send.md` for full workflow.

### `html` — Generate HTML for Browser Paste

See `runbooks/browser-paste.md` for the full workflow.

## Conventions

- **Never send without approval** — always push to Gmail Drafts first, wait for user to say "send"
- Always use `file:///` protocol for browser-openable file paths
- Always search for existing threads before creating standalone emails
- For Gmail replies, `in_reply_to` must be the original message ID; `thread_id` is a separate Gmail API field
- Gmail threading requires matching subjects — use `Re: <original subject>`
- HTML emails use inline CSS (Gmail strips `<style>` tags)
- Draft content comes from agent-doc session context — read correspondence, resume, and contact files as needed
- Verify facts against `mail/contacts/<name>/CLAUDE.md` before sending
- Attachment paths must be absolute (tilde `~` not expanded for attachments in corky)
- Use `corky doctor gmail --json` when a connector or automation needs auth/scope state without scraping stderr
