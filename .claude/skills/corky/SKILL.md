# Corky — Correspondence Kit

Manage email, calendar, documents, and communications from the command line.

## Core Principles
- **Draft only** — never send email directly; always save as a draft for human review
- **Match voice** — follow the Writing Voice guidelines in voice.md
- **Use context** — read relevant threads in `conversations/` before drafting

## Data Paths
- `conversations/` — synced email threads as Markdown
- `contacts/{name}/AGENTS.md` — per-contact context
- `manifest.toml` — thread index
- `drafts/` — outgoing email drafts

## Commands

### Email
```text
corky unanswered                      # threads awaiting reply
corky draft new --to EMAIL "Subject" # scaffold a new draft
corky draft validate                 # validate draft format
corky sync                           # sync threads from IMAP
corky contact add --from SLUG        # create contact from conversation
corky contact info NAME              # show contact details
```

### Calendar
```text
corky cal auth                                           # Google Calendar OAuth2
corky cal list [--limit N] [--query Q]                  # upcoming events
corky cal create <SUMMARY> <START> <END> [--description] [--location]
                                                         # create event
corky cal check <START> <END>                           # check availability
corky cal delete <QUERY> [--all] [--dry-run]            # delete events
```

### Documents
